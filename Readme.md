# 🎓 freeCodeCamp Project

This repository contains one of my projects built as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate skills learned through the lessons, and to build a portfolio-worthy piece of work.

## 🚀 Project Overview
  This documentation is a static web page that provides a basic guide to Java programming. Built using HTML and CSS, it covers essential topics such as variables, Java syntax, operators, control structures, OOP, and more. Each section is linked through a sidebar navigation on the left, making it easy for users to explore the content. The layout is designed to be clean and responsive for comfortable reading across different devices.
